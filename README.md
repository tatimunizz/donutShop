# donutShop
A simple responsive donut Shop aplication with API call.

I started this project after finishing a Javascript course, so please
let me know if you have any comments or hints on possible improvements.
Thanks in advance!

I've used:
    HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and JSON (API)
    IDE: JetBrains Webstorm 2020.2
